## In this episode we are going to learn about the MERN.
we will be discussing these Three questions and we cover this topic

## 1st - What is MERN?

MERN is just a word that contains  4 different letters and those 4 different letters represent 4 different diff tech.
Combintg those 4 different tech we make a stack called mern stack.
These 4 different tech are M-Mongodb E-ExpressJs R-Reactjs N-Nodejs
Using these 4 diifferent tech we make a full stack applications 

Now what is the meaning of full stack application. A application that contains both frontend and backend. 
the Frontend refers to the part of a web or mobile application that the user interacts with directly. It's the part of the application that the user sees and interacts with, including the user interface, design, and layout.
the Backend refers to the part of an application that runs on the server and is responsible for processing data, managing application logic, and communicating with other servers or services.

## 2nd- How mern works?

MERN is a full-stack web development framework consisting of four main technologies: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. Here is a brief overview of how each of these technologies work together to build a web application using the MERN stack:

MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a JSON-like format, which makes it easy to work with in JavaScript. MongoDB is used as the data storage layer of a MERN application.

Express: Express is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of tools for building web applications and APIs, including HTTP handling, routing, and middleware support. Express is used to create the server-side logic of a MERN application.

React: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create reusable components and manage the state of your application in a declarative way. React is used to build the frontend of a MERN application.

Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server. It provides a set of tools for building web applications, including HTTP handling, file system access, and network I/O.

In a MERN application, the backend is built using Node.js and Express. Express provides an API that can be accessed by the frontend, which is built using React. React allows developers to create a dynamic and responsive user interface that interacts with the backend through the API provided by Express.

When a user interacts with the frontend, the request is sent to the backend via the API provided by Express. The backend then retrieves or manipulates data stored in MongoDB, and returns the data to the frontend through the API. The frontend then uses the data to update the user interface, providing a dynamic and responsive user experience.

Overall, the MERN stack is a powerful and flexible way to build full-stack web applications, allowing developers to build complex applications with a rich and dynamic user experience.

## Why MERN? 

The main reason why someone might choose MERN over MEAN is because of the popularity and flexibility of React. React is a very powerful and flexible frontend library that allows for building reusable and interactive components. It has a large and active community that provides a vast array of open-source libraries and tools, making it a popular choice for building web applications.

Angular, on the other hand, is a complete framework that provides a lot of built-in features, which can be great for building large and complex applications but can also be more difficult to learn and work with than React. Additionally, the development community for Angular is somewhat smaller than that of React, which can make it more difficult to find resources and support.

Overall, the choice between MERN and MEAN largely depends on personal preference and the specific needs of the project. Both frameworks provide a powerful and flexible set of tools for building full-stack web applications, and the decision of which one to use largely depends on the specific needs of the project and the preferences of the development team.
