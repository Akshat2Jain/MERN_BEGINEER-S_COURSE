## Express Js

### What is Express Js

Express.js is a popular and lightweight web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs. It provides a set of features for creating server-side applications, including middleware support, routing, and template engines.

Express.js is built on top of Node.js, which means it inherits its fast, event-driven, and non-blocking I/O model, making it a good choice for building scalable and high-performance applications. Express.js allows developers to easily create RESTful APIs by providing a simple and consistent interface for handling HTTP requests and responses.

With Express.js, developers can quickly create web applications using popular tools and technologies such as MongoDB, Mongoose, Socket.IO, and Passport.js. It also supports a wide range of middleware and extensions that can be used to add additional functionality to the application.

Overall, Express.js is a versatile and flexible framework that enables developers to build web applications quickly and efficiently, making it a popular choice for both small and large-scale projects.

### Some terms before Creating the server

REST API: REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and a RESTful API is an architectural style for building web services that follows certain principles and constraints. RESTful APIs use HTTP requests to GET (retrieve), POST (create), PUT (update), and DELETE (delete) data.

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These operations are the basic functions that are performed on data in a database or a persistent storage system

Create: This operation is used to create a new record or entry in the database. For example, when you add a new user to a database, you are performing a create operation.

Read: This operation is used to retrieve or read data from the database. For example, when you search for a particular user's information, you are performing a read operation.

Update: This operation is used to modify or update an existing record or entry in the database. For example, when you change a user's email address, you are performing an update operation.

Delete: This operation is used to delete or remove an existing record or entry from the database. For example, when you remove a user from a database, you are performing a delete operation.

These four basic operations form the foundation for most database management systems and are essential for managing data in a reliable and efficient manner.

Now assume the same operation performing in terms of api's .
We have get put post and delete

Json : Json is just the represntation of data in object key value form

```
import express from "express";
```

```
const app = express();
```

```
app.listen(9002, () => {
  console.log("Listining on 9002 port!");
});

```

```
app.post("/anyendpoint", (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body);
  const { username, email, password } = req.body;
});
```
```
app.get("/anyendpoint",(req,res)=>{
res.send("Hello");
    })
```
