## Express Js

### What is Express Js

Express.js is a popular and lightweight web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs. It provides a set of features for creating server-side applications, including middleware support, routing, and template engines.

Express.js is built on top of Node.js, which means it inherits its fast, event-driven, and non-blocking I/O model, making it a good choice for building scalable and high-performance applications. Express.js allows developers to easily create RESTful APIs by providing a simple and consistent interface for handling HTTP requests and responses.

With Express.js, developers can quickly create web applications using popular tools and technologies such as MongoDB, Mongoose, Socket.IO, and Passport.js. It also supports a wide range of middleware and extensions that can be used to add additional functionality to the application.

Overall, Express.js is a versatile and flexible framework that enables developers to build web applications quickly and efficiently, making it a popular choice for both small and large-scale projects.
